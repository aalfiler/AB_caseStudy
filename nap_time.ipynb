    "- **Background**: After a turkey meal, blood levels of tryptophan rise, which may amplify the pineal's production of such serotonin, but not melatonin, whose synthesis rate depends on the amount of enzymes available for the subsequent biochemical reactions to occur. If turkey is not the culprit, then what besides dessert causes post-Thanksgiving torpidity? It may simply be a function of scarfing down enormous quantities of food. \"Studies have indicated that stretching of the small intestine induces sleepiness and a protein–fat loading of the stomach induces sleepiness,\" says biologist H. Craig Heller at Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif., \"and, more blood going to the gastrointestinal tract means less going elsewhere,\"—for example, the brain or skeletal muscle.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Objective**: Analyze dataset to gain insight on the different types of food served during Thanksgiving that can help create a product that helps adults stay awake after their meal.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hypotheses**: Eating too much during Thanksgiving meal may cause post-meal fatigue.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Questions**: \n",
    "    1. What is the main dish served during Thanksgiving? What is the preferred way that it's cooked? \n",
    "    2. What are the common side dishes served? \n",
    "    3. What are the characteristics of the responders? (income, age, gender, geographical location)\n",
    "    4. How far do responders typically travel for Thanksgiving? Could the post-meal fatigue be from traveling?\n",
    "    5. What are the limitations of this dataset? \n",
    "    6. What additional data would be useful to have?"
