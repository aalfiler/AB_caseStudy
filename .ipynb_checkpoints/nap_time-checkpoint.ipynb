    "- **Background**: After a turkey meal, blood levels of tryptophan rise, which may amplify the pineal's production of such serotonin, but not melatonin, whose synthesis rate depends on the amount of enzymes available for the subsequent biochemical reactions to occur. If turkey is not the culprit, then what besides dessert causes post-Thanksgiving torpidity? It may simply be a function of scarfing down enormous quantities of food. \"Studies have indicated that stretching of the small intestine induces sleepiness and a protein–fat loading of the stomach induces sleepiness,\" says biologist H. Craig Heller at Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif., \"and, more blood going to the gastrointestinal tract means less going elsewhere,\"—for example, the brain or skeletal muscle.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Objective**: Analyze dataset to gain insight on the different types of food served during Thanksgiving that can help create a product that helps adults stay awake after their meal.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hypotheses**: Eating too much during Thanksgiving meal may cause post-meal fatigue.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Questions**: \n",
    "    1. What is the main dish served during Thanksgiving? What is the preferred way that it's cooked? \n",
    "    2. What are the common side dishes served? \n",
    "    3. What are the characteristics of the responders? (income, age, gender, geographical location)\n",
    "    4. How far do responders typically travel for Thanksgiving? Could the post-meal fatigue be from traveling?\n",
    "    5. What are the limitations of this dataset? \n",
    "    6. What additional data would be useful to have?"

    "- It's important to track the operator in order to have a point person when questions arise anytime during the process\n",
    "- Shipment arrival date/time, shipping condition, freezer location at intake (must be logged in appropriate storage per sample type)\n",
    "- Freezer temperature must be tracked throughout the day to preserve sample integrity\n",
    "- Assign each sample a unique ID and each container a unique ID. Multiple aliquots of the same sample should be assigned the same sample ID but different container ID - this is important if the client only wants to process one aliquot and hold the rest of the containers as reserve.\n",
    "- Container types (gDNA plates and tubes are easier to accession compare to others)\n",
    "- At intake, sample type and source determines the extraction method and sample input per assay\n",
    "- Any type of discrepancies (mislabeling, metadata issues, sample integrity etc.) that prevent positively ID-ing the samples for lab processing. How long it takes to resolve these issues must also be tracked.\n",

    "### 3. What would be your general course of action from start to finish?\n",
    "- Consult the subject matter experts from the BSM team and learn about their current workflow \n",
    "- Check if the target metrics mentioned above are captured in CORA/LIMS \n",
    "- Identify pain points - make sure this is captured in the report \n",
    "- Create dashboard containing metrics above - filter by time of the quarter, project type (pharma, antigen map etc.) \n",
    "- QC and validate report\n",
